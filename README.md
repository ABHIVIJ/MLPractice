Trying out various basic ML algos in this yearprediction from music dataset

***************************************************************************

Before running this code :
1.)download the practice dataset from the link mentioned and save it in the same directory as program files 
2.)type in the commented line of code, to load the dataset directly in octave(to avoid loading dataset multiple times when code is executed multiple times)

***************************************************************************

Algos used :
1.) Linear regression using gradient descent with feature normalization
2.) Predicting the majority year as the output
3.) Logistic regression with regularization
	lambda = 0
